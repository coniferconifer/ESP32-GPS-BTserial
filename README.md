# ESP32 dual GPS-BT-server with watch dog timer

By hooking up two multiGNSS GPS modules to ESP32, 
This program read NMEA from two GPS modules and averages latitude,longitude,height and course, then 
outputs NMEA to Bluetooth Serial Port Profile.

NMEA can be monitored by ESP32's USB serial port.

Only \$GNGGA and \$GNRMC are regenerated by this program.
Other \$??GSV , \$??GSA and \$??TXT of GPS2 are just relayed to the output. 
You can monitor how this works by u-center or other NMEA monitoring tools.

When Serial BT stalls , software watch dog timer reboots ESP32.

Use your external GPS module as Android's internal GPS.

Step1. Configure mock-location on Android.

Step2. Run Lefebure NTRIP Client on Android to replace from Android phone's embeded GPS to your GPS.
No need to set up NTRIP server if your GPS module does not support RTK GPS.

## How to wire your GPS module
https://shop.m5stack.com/products/mini-gps-bds-unit

GPS1 TX should be connected to GPIO_NUM_33 of ESP32

GPS2 TX should be connected to GPIO_NUM_16 of ESP32

GPS used to test : M5stack GPS module (using AT6558) , connected by 9600bps serial.
